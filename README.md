# MediCap - Medical Image Captioning

A deep learning project for automatic caption generation from medical images, implemented in Jupyter Notebook.

## Overview

MediCap is a medical image captioning system that automatically generates descriptive text for medical images. This project aims to assist healthcare professionals by providing automated analysis and descriptions of medical imaging data[4].

## Features

- Automatic caption generation for medical images
- Deep learning-based approach using neural networks
- Jupyter Notebook implementation for easy experimentation and visualization
- Focus on medical imaging applications

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Deep learning libraries (TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- Medical imaging libraries
- Standard data science libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/koustav24/MediCap.git
cd MediCap
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Image_Captioning_On_Medical_Images.ipynb
```

## Usage

Open the `Image_Captioning_On_Medical_Images.ipynb` notebook and follow the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Data Loading**: Load and preprocess medical image datasets
2. **Model Architecture**: Build the image captioning model
3. **Training**: Train the model on medical image-caption pairs
4. **Evaluation**: Test the model and generate captions for new images
5. **Visualization**: Display results and model performance

## Medical Image Captioning Applications

Medical image captioning has several important applications in healthcare:

- **Automated Report Generation**: Generate preliminary impressions for medical reports[4]
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Assist radiologists and medical professionals
- **Medical Education**: Provide educational descriptions of medical conditions
- **Healthcare Efficiency**: Reduce time spent on manual report writing[4]

## Related Work

This project builds upon the growing field of medical image captioning, which includes notable works like:

- **MedICap**: A concise model that won the ImageCLEFmedical Caption 2023 challenge[2][3]
- **MedCLIP**: Medical image captioning using CLIP architecture[6]
- **MedICaT**: Large-scale dataset of medical images and captions[5]

## Model Architecture

The implementation likely follows common medical image captioning approaches:

- **Encoder**: Extracts visual features from medical images
- **Decoder**: Generates descriptive text based on visual features[2]
- **Attention Mechanism**: Focuses on relevant image regions during caption generation

## Dataset

Medical image captioning typically uses datasets such as:
- Chest X-ray datasets with associated reports
- Medical image collections with expert annotations
- Open access medical literature with figure captions[5]
